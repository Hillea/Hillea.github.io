    "text": "I am a Postdoc working in the Experimental Clinical Psychology Group at the University of Wuerzburg, Germany. Here I work on the mechanisms of social attention, specifically the effect of social presence, using virtual reality, eye tracking, and autonomic measures. I also work on a VR project investigating defensive responses (i.e. freezing, fight-or-flight) to threats. I currently supervise bachelor theses on a range of topics (see projects). I’m a strong proponent of open science practices, and love R and statistics.\nI am also the coordinator of the Research Training Group 2660. In this function, I am organizing events, workshops and a yearly summer school, have an open ear for the doctoral researchers, and am responsible for everything “behind the scenes” (Executive Board meetings, finances) to make the RTG run smoothly. I love this job.\nIn addition, I am currently training to become a systemic psychotherapist.\nPreviously, I did my PhD at the Department for Social Neuroscience at the MPI for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, where I worked (also using virtual reality and peripheral physiological measures) on a longitudinal study on the effects of mental training on emotion regulation. I have master’s degrees both in Psychology and Neuroscience."
